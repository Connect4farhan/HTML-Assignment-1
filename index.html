            <p class="pera"> <b><u>My UI design book.Adham DannawayNovember 2022</u></b><br>
                After nearly 2 decades working as a product designer, I wrote down my logic-driven approach to
                UI design. Here’s a quick behind the scenes look at the making of my UI design book.
                <b><u>Why I wrote the book</u></b>
                Over the years I’ve realised that most of my UI design decisions are governed by a system of
                logical rules. Not artistic flair or magical intuition, just simple rules. They’re actually more like
                <b><u>helpful guidelines than strict rules.</u></b>
                The guidelines are mostly based on conventional best practices, which seem to have been
                forgotten over the years. Many of the guidelines are based on how our bodies work. How our
                eyes perceive things, how our brains interpret them, and how we interact with a user interface.
                I wish I’d known these guidelines when I first started out in product design, as they would have
                saved me many years of research and experimentation. My hope is that they’ll help you gain
                years of visual and interaction design experience in a matter of hours.

        <h1 class="heading">Creating a lean design system.</h1>
        <p class="pera">I created a much-needed design system for the existing website, iOS and Android platforms. My
            goal was to keep things simple and flexible to ensure that it would actually be used.
            Consistently inconsistent
            Before being acquired by BetEasy, William Hill was a sports betting company with a website,
            iOS app and Android app. At first glance, each platform looked relatively polished, but upon
            closer inspection, it was clear that there were significant design inconsistencies throughout.
            Designers were confused as there was no single source of truth. Developers were frustrated
            with creating duplicate components which slowed them down. Users were struggling to learn
            multiple UI patterns to perform the same task. These issues would only get worse as our
            product team grew. There was no budget or resources to create a dedicated design system
            team, so we simply chipped away at it as best we could, creating new components and styles
            incrementally. Some new Android components can be seen in the image above.</p>
