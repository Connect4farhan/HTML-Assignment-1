    <p class="pera"> The National Mausoleum, the Mazar-e-Quaid is the tomb of the founder of
        Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Sited in the center of Karachi, Pakistan on a natural plateau,
        this marble structure was designed by the Indian architect Yahya Merchant and was completed
        in 1970.
        The mausoleum serves as the final resting place for Jinnah as well as Liaqat Ali Khan, (the first
        Prime Minister of Pakistan), Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah (Jinnahs sister), Abdur Rab Nishtar and
        Nurul Amin.
        Upon entrance through one of the four pointed arches entering into the mausoleum, visitors
        enter into a grand octagonal space with a ceremonial sarcophagus in its center (the actual
        tomb, expectedly, is in a subterranean chamber directly beneath the ceremonial sarcophagus).
        In addition to its functional purpose as a mausoleum, Mazar-e-Quaid also serves as host to a
        variety of governmental and military ceremonies.</p>

    <h2 class="head"><b>Clifton <span> Beach</span></b></h2>
    <img class="image2" src="../Image/Clifton Beach Karachi 3.jpg" alt="Clifton Beach">
    <p class="pera"> Karachi is the most prominent coastal city of Pakistan and beach lovers here have many
        opportunities to visit different beaches bordering the Arabian Sea. Clifton Beach is purported to
        give the best value in leisure and recreational opportunities for fun seekers and beach lovers.
        In recent times, the area surrounding the beach has seen massive commercial activity as it is
        located in one of the most sought after localities in Karachi. The beach is now home to multiple
        local leisure activities including camel rides, buggy rides, horse rides, plastic plane flying among
        others. The Seaview Apartments across from the beach is a gated residential area which is
        rated among the top properties in the city. Other apartments and villas which can be seen along
        the Clifton beach coasts are becoming popular as well.
        Previously, Clifton Beach had only had a few small shops known as "Corniche Points", where
        visitors could buy things like mineral water, samosas, chai and other foodstuffs.
        Now, Clifton Beach offers a variety of restaurants, including a McDonald's, and is bustling with
        and a multitude of vendors that entertain visitors.Do Darya restaurant is located further
        away from the main beach area but is still one of the hottest dining spots in Karachi. Sites like
        Chunky Monkey have also opened up for families to enjoy rides at a reasonable prices.
        Extensive further revitalization is being planned.
        In 2003 it was noted that historic sites were deteriorating because of government neglect and
        lack of sanitation facilities for tourists. The monuments at risk included Lady Lloyd Pier, Jehangir
        Kothari Pavilion and his bungalow, Jehangir Kothari Parade, and the Katrak bandstand.In
        2005, Clifton Beach Park was opened as part of the renovation of the historic Kothari Parade
        and Bagh Ibn-i-Qasim.In recent times, the local government and civil society has tried to
        make the place beautiful and tourist-friendly again. Attempts include the installation of themed
        dustbins in the shape of Giant Fish and cleanup campaigns by local civil society members.
        There have also been a few urban forests such as Clifton Urban Forest planted to improve the
        conditions and beauty of the area.[</p>

    <img class="image2" src="../Image/Empress Market karachi.jpg" width="600" height="500" alt="Empress Market">
    <p class="pera"> The Empress Market was constructed between 1884 and 1889 and was named to
        commemorate Queen Victoria, Empress of India.The market was constructed at a
        well-chosen site that was clearly visible from a great distance. The site of the market had
        historical significance as it was situated on the grounds where a number of native sepoys were
        executed after the failed 1857 uprising against British rule. Accounts mention that the sepoys
        had their heads blown off by cannonballs in an attempt to suppress any mutinous feelings
        among the locals.The British fearing that the local population will build a monument to honor
        the executed sepoys instead built the Empress Market to commemorate Queen Victoria.
        The foundation stone of the Empress Market was laid by the-then Governor of Bombay, James
        Fergusson in 1884, who also laid the foundation of the Merewether Memorial Tower. It was
        designed by James Strachan (architect), the foundations were completed by the English firm of
        A.J. Attfield, and the building was constructed by the local firm of 'Mahoomed Niwan and Dulloo
        Khejoo'. The building was arranged around a courtyard, 130 ft by 100 ft, with four galleries each
        46 ft wide. The galleries provided accommodation for 280 shops and stall keepers; at the time of
        its construction it was one of only seven markets in Karachi</p>

    <h2 class="head"><b>Mohatta <span>Palace</span></b></h2>
    <img class="image2" src="../Image/Mohatta Palace 1.jpg" alt="Mohatta Palace">
    <p class="pera"> For ancient mariners, the delta of the Indus served as an important geographical landmark.
        Karachi continued as an entrepot for trade along both land and sea routes for several centuries,
        until the British began to expand their colonial administration under the aegis of the East India
        Company. Recognising the commercial and strategic importance of Karachi as a means of
        access to the entire north western flank of the sub-continent and beyond it, to Russia, they
        annexed Sindh in 1843.
        The presence and authority of the British were reflected in the architecture they adopted for
        army cantonments, municipal buildings, churches and formal residences in Karachi. The late
        19th and early 20th centuries saw new styles of architecture in the sub-continent that were a
        fusion of European, Victorian, Gothic and Mughal elements suited to local forms and materials.
        Karachi rose to prominence at an astonishingly rapid pace, attracting people from the north
        west, the Iranian plateau, Turkey and Central Asia and from the south east, especially Kutch,
        Bombay and Rajasthan.
        History of the Museum: Shiv Rattan Mohatta
        In 1927, Shiv Rattan Mohatta, a successful Marwari entrepreneur, commissioned a palatial
        house in the affluent seaside neighbourhood of Clifton. Mohatta had made his fortune as a ship
        handler and trader. The architect commissioned for his palace, Ahmed Hussein Agha, was one
        of the first Muslim architects of India and had come from Jaipur to take up an assignment as
        chief surveyor for the Karachi Muncipality. Ahmed Hussein Agha designed a number of
        buildings in Karachi but Mohatta Palace was to prove the coup de maitre of his professional
        career. Working in a Mughal revival style with a combination of locally available yellow Gizri and
        pink stone from Jodhpur, he sought to recreate the Anglo Mughal palaces of the Rajput princes</p>
