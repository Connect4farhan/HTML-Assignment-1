    <div><img class="mainimage" src="../Image/blog 0.jpg" alt="Build with Gemini">
        <p class="pera">Last week, we announced Gemini, our largest and most capable AI model and the next step in our
            journey to make AI
            more helpful for everyone. It comes in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. We've already started rolling out
            Gemini in our products: Gemini Nano is in Android, starting with Pixel 8 Pro, and a specifically tuned
            version
            of Gemini Pro is in Bard.
            Today, we’re making Gemini Pro available for developers and enterprises to build for your own use cases, and
            we’ll be further fine-tuning it in the weeks and months ahead as we listen and learn from your feedback.</p>
    </div>
    <h1 class="heading">Gemini Pro is available today</h1>
    <p class="pera">The first version of Gemini Pro is now accessible via the Gemini API and here’s more about it:

        Gemini Pro outperforms other similarly-sized models on research benchmarks.
        Today’s version comes with a 32K context window for text, and future versions will have a larger context window.
        It’s free to use right now, within limits, and it will be competitively priced.
        It comes with a range of features: function calling, embeddings, semantic retrieval and custom knowledge
        grounding, and chat functionality.
        It supports 38 languages across 180+ countries and territories worldwide.
        In today’s release, Gemini Pro accepts text as input and generates text as output. We’ve also made a dedicated
        Gemini Pro Vision multimodal endpoint available today that accepts text and imagery as input, with text output.
        SDKs are available for Gemini Pro to help you build apps that run anywhere. Python, Android (Kotlin), Node.js,
        Swift and JavaScript are all supported.</p>

    <h1 class="heading">Google AI Studio: <br> The fastest way to build with Gemini</h1>
    <p class="pera">Google AI Studio is a free, web-based developer tool that enables you to quickly develop prompts and
        then get an
        API key to use in your app development. You can sign into Google AI Studio with your Google account and take
        advantage of the free quota, <br>which allows 60 requests per minute — 20x more than other free offerings. When
        you’re ready, you can simply click on “Get code” to transfer your work to your IDE of choice, or use one of the
        quickstart templates available in Android Studio, Colab or Project IDX. To help us improve product quality, when
        you use the free quota, your API and Google AI Studio input and output may be accessible to trained reviewers.
        This data is de-identified from your Google account and API key.</p>

    <h1 class="heading">Build with Vertex AI on Google Cloud</h1>
    <p class="pera">When it's time for a fully-managed AI platform, you can easily transition from Google AI Studio to
        Vertex AI,
        which allows for customization of Gemini with full data control and benefits from additional Google Cloud
        features for enterprise security, safety, privacy and data governance and compliance.

        With Vertex AI, you will have access to the same Gemini models, and will be able to:

        Tune and distill Gemini with your own company’s data, and augment it with grounding to include up-to-minute
        information and extensions to take real-world actions.
        Build Gemini-powered search and conversational agents in a low code / no code environment, including support for
        retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), blended search, embeddings, conversation playbooks and more.
        Deploy with confidence. We never train our models on inputs or outputs from Google Cloud customers. Your data
        and IP are always your data and IP.
        To read more about our new Vertex AI capabilities, visit the Google Cloud blog.</p>
